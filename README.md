Forge to MC Launcher is a lightweight tool to transfer your Modprofiles from CusreForge to the default Minecraft Launcher. This will save you a lot of time in the future!

<h2>Quick installation guide</h2>
<br>
<h3>Step 1</h3>
Downlaod ForgeToMCLauncher over the releases page on the right side of this page. Unpack the zip Folder and run the
"ForgeToMcLauncher.exe"-file. If a blue smartscreen window pops up simply click on "more information" and then "run anyways" on the bottom. If can now see the ForgeToMcLaucher Window(see below), skip along to Step2.

<br>

If your'e getting an error message that .NET is missing, click on the link on the error-message to get to the downlaods-page of .NET by Microsoft. Just download the Installer for .NET there and install it like
any other Software on your PC. Now open ForgeToMcLauncher again and you should see the "Forge to MC Launcher Window"

<h3>Step 2</h3>
On the ForgeToMcLauncher-Window you should now see two file directories. If the Next button isn't grayed out and no red error-text is visible under the two given directories just click "next". If you can now see your Mod-Profiles in the List you can skip to Step3 now.
<br>
If there are errors below the directories you may have to configure them first. The location of the Top-Folder is at %appdata%\.minecraft by default. It includes your libraries and versions Folder. This folder shouldn't cause any problems when you have installed the default Minecraft Launcher from minecraft.net/download.
<br>
If you see an error on the second Directory (Select CurseForge "minecraft" Folder) you may have Curseforge installed on a custom directory. Here's a quick Fix:
<br>
<br>
Launch CurseForge and click on the "Minecraft"-tab to get to this screen

Now Click on the three dots on the top right and click on "Open Modding Folder"

Finaly, paste the path into the second directory on the ForgeToMcLauncher-Window. Another important thing is to make shure that you have played the Modpacks you want to transfer with this tool once before using it.
<br>
All Errors should now be resolved! (If not message me pls)

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<br>
Now you should see all your Modprofiles in this list.
Make shure you have played the profiles over CurseForge once before you transfer them with my tool.

Now just tick the profiles you want to transfer and click "Run". Enjoy!
